# arduino-projects

This repo houses mini-projects associated with the Arduino tutorial series by Paul McWhorter: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLGs0VKk2DiYw-L-RibttcvK-WBZm8WLEP

### Folder Structures

Each folder in the root of this project is a separate mini-project associated with one of Paul's videos.  Each of these subfolders will contain the following:

1. A README with a link to the corresponding video
2. A reference picture of the Arduino circuit with a naming convention of - {Project Name} Arduino Circuit Picture.png
3. A component list outlining required components with a naming convention of - {Project Name} Component List.csv
4. A circuit schematic with a naming convention of - {Project Name} Schematic.pdf
5. Source code in the src folder


Note that my code may or may not be consistent with Paul's suggested homeworks.  I generally look for something interesting to do that helps me practice building circuits and/or following different coding patterns.
